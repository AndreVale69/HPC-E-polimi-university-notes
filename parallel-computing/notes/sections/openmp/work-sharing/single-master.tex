\subsubsection{Single/Master}

A \textbf{section} (not the directive) \textbf{of code should be executed on a single thread, not necessarily the main (master) thread}. The \texttt{single} directive identifies a construct that specifies that the associated structured block is executed by only one thread in the team (not necessarily the master thread).

\begin{openmpbox}[: \texttt{single} and \texttt{master}]
\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++]
#pragma omp parallel
{
    #pragma omp single
    {
        /* code section */
    }
    # pragma omp master
    {
        /* code section */
    }
}\end{lstlisting}
\end{openmpbox}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{single} specifies that a section of a code is \textbf{executed only by a single thread}.\marginpar{

    }

    
    \item \texttt{master} specifies that a section of a code is \textbf{executed only by the master}.\marginpar{
        \href{https://www.openmp.org/spec-html/5.0/openmpse24.html\#x118-4380002.16} {Doc. \faIcon{book}}
    }
\end{itemize}

\noindent
There's an \textbf{implicit barrier} after the \texttt{single} construct unless a \texttt{nowait} clause is specified.
