\subsection{Languages Need Memory Models Too}

Memory models are critical not only for hardware systems, but also for programming languages. They provide a framework that defines how memory operations (reads and writes) can be ordered and observed by multiple threads. This chapter discusses the importance of memory models in programming languages and how they help maintain consistency and predictability in multi-threaded programs.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \important{Invisible Optimizations}. Compilers can optimize code in ways that are not directly visible to the programmer, such as reordering instructions to enhance performance.
    \begin{examplebox}[: optimization \emph{not} visible to programmer]
        Code written by the programmer:
        \begin{lstlisting}
X = 0
for i = 0 to 100:
    X = 1
    print X\end{lstlisting}
        Code optimized by the compiler:
        \begin{lstlisting}
X = 1
for i = 0 to 100:
    print X\end{lstlisting}
    \end{examplebox}
    These \textbf{optimizations can lead to unexpected behaviors in multi-threaded programs if not properly managed}.
    
    \item \important{Visible Optimizations}. When optimizations are visible to the programmer, it becomes essential to understand how these changes affect the execution order and consistency of memory operations.
    \begin{examplebox}[: optimization \emph{is} visible to programmer]
        Code written by the programmer:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Thread 1
            \begin{lstlisting}
X = 0
for i = 0 to 100:
    X = 1
    print X\end{lstlisting}
            \item Thread 2
            \begin{lstlisting}
X = 0\end{lstlisting}
            \item Expected result: \texttt{111111111...}
            \item Result obtained: \texttt{111110111...}
        \end{itemize}
        Code optimized by the compiler:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Thread 1
            \begin{lstlisting}
X = 1
for i = 0 to 100:
    print X\end{lstlisting}
            \item Thread 2
            \begin{lstlisting}
X = 0\end{lstlisting}
            \item Expected result: \texttt{111111111...}
            \item Result obtained: \texttt{111110000...}
        \end{itemize}
    \end{examplebox}
\end{itemize}

\end{flushleft}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \important{Contract to Programmers}. Memory models provide a contract to programmers, ensuring that \textbf{memory operations will be reordered by the compiler in a way that maintains consistency}. For example, there should be no reordering of shared memory operations that could lead to race conditions.
    \item \important{Guarantees}. Modern languages like C11, C++11, and Java 5 guarantee sequential consistency for data-race-free programs, meaning that the program's behavior will be predictable if there are no data races.
\end{itemize}

\end{flushleft}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \important{Data Races}. \textbf{Without proper synchronization, data races can occur, leading to non-deterministic and buggy behavior}. Programs with data races do not have any guarantees and can produce unpredictable results.
    \item \important{Synchronization Libraries}. Using synchronization primitives like locks, barriers, and memory fences ensures that memory operations are executed in the correct order, preventing data races and maintaining program correctness.

Memory models at the language level are essential for maintaining consistency and predictability in multi-threaded programs. They help manage compiler optimizations and provide a framework for programmers to ensure that their code behaves correctly, even when memory operations are reordered.
