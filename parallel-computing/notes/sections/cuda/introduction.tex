\subsection{Introduction}

\definition{CUDA}, which stands for \textbf{Compute Unified Device Architecture}, is a \textbf{parallel computing platform and application programming interface (API) model created by NVIDIA}. It allows developers to use the power of GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) for general-purpose processing, which enables substantial performance improvements for computationally intensive tasks.

GPUs, originally designed to render graphics, have evolved into \textbf{highly efficient and powerful processors capable of handling thousands of threads simultaneously}. This transformation has made GPUs, and by extension CUDA, incredibly valuable for applications requiring massive parallelism, such as scientific simulations, machine learning, and deep learning.

Understanding the fundamental differences between CPU and GPU architectures is key to appreciating CUDA's advantages:
\begin{itemize}
    \item CPU (Central Processing Unit):
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Designed for sequential processing.
        \item Features powerful Arithmetic Logic Units (ALUs) with low latency.
        \item Utilizes large hierarchical caches to optimize access to frequently used data.
        \item Employs advanced control mechanisms, such as branch prediction and data forwarding, to minimize delays.
    \end{itemize}

    \item GPU (Graphics Processing Unit):
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Optimized for parallel processing.
        \item Contains a large number of simpler, pipelined ALUs designed for high-throughput computations, despite having longer latency.
        \item Relies on smaller caches to facilitate high memory throughput.
        \item Uses simpler control mechanisms, enabling efficient context switching and handling many threads concurrently.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
CUDA leverages these GPU characteristics to execute programs with a parallel-first approach, breaking down tasks into smaller, manageable pieces and processing them simultaneously. This approach leads to significant speedups compared to traditional CPU-only processing, making CUDA a pivotal technology for high-performance computing.
