# (2024/2025) Parallel Computing

These notes are an unofficial resource and shouldn't replace the course material or any other book on _parallel computing_. It is not made for commercial purposes. I've made the following notes to help me improve my knowledge and maybe it can be helpful for everyone.

As I have highlighted, a student should choose the teacher's material or a book on the topic. These notes can only be a helpful material.

The notes are taken from the books required for the course: 

- Course slides.

You can view/download the PDF [here](notes/parallel-computing.pdf). In the [notes folder](notes/), you can also see the source code.

In the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) file you can see the changes made to each version of the PDF file. The versioning can be helpful if you want to understand if there are any new features/fixes in the file.

For any issue, [use the appropriate section](https://github.com/PoliMI-HPC-E-notes-projects-AndreVale69/HPC-E-PoliMI-university-notes/issues).

## Course Syllabus

According to the [official course syllabus](https://www11.ceda.polimi.it/schedaincarico/schedaincarico/controller/scheda_pubblica/SchedaPublic.do?&evn_default=evento&c_classe=836280&__pj0=0&__pj1=442fa6ae26032c1734261c6daa9790b9):

**Main lectures topics**:
- Motivations for parallel chips, processor basics: why parallelism? 
- Multicore processors, SIMD processors, Memory models. 
- GPU architectures 
- Heterogenous parallel processing & Accelerators 
- Parallel programming abstractions: PRAM model. 
- Parallel programming basics: multithreading, data parallelism, shared memory space, memory consistency, synchronization. 
- Tools and languages for parallel programming: Posix threads, OpenMP, Message Passing Interface, and CUDA. 
- Parallel programming performance analysis and optimization. 
- Data and computation parallel patterns: map, reduce, scan, gather, scatter, etc. 
- Domain-specific programming languages: Halide.

**Innovative Learning**. The innovative learning activities in the course will be provided by the following active-classroom forms:
- Selected topics covered in a flipped-classroom form
- Blended-classroom exercise sessions (after an example explained by the teacher, students solve exercises and present and discuss results)
