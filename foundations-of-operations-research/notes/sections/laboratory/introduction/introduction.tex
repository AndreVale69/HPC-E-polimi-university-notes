\subsection{Introduction}

For this course of Foundations of Operations Research we will use the \texttt{mip} package (\href{https://www.python-mip.com/}{official website}, \href{https://python-mip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html}{installation guide}) for modelling optimization problems in Python. The mip package is a collection of Python tools for the modeling and solution of Mixed-Integer Linear programs (MIPs).
