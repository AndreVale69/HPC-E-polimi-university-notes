\subsection{Mathematical Programming or Simulation?}

Mathematical Programming and Simulation involves \textbf{building a model} and \textbf{designing an algorithm}. And the main differences are:

        \textbf{Mathematical Programming} & \textbf{Simulation} \\
        \midrule
        Problem can be \dquotes{well} formalized. & Problem is difficult to formalize. \\
        \cmidrule{1-2}
        Algorithm yields a(n optimal) solution. & Algorithm simulates the evolution of the real system and allows to evaluate the performance of alternative solutions. \\
        \cmidrule{1-2}
        The results are \dquotes{certain} & The results need to be interpreted. \\

        Example: assignment. & Example: service counters. \\
