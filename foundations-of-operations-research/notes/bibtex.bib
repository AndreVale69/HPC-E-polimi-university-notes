	abstract="Minimum spanning tree (MST) problems play an important role in many networking applications, such as routing and network planning. In many cases, such as wireless ad-hoc networks, this requires efficient high-performance and low-power implementations that can run at regular intervals in real time on embedded platforms. In this paper, we study custom software and hardware realizations of one common algorithm for MST computations, Prim's algorithm. We specifically investigate a performance-optimized realization of this algorithm on reconfigurable hardware, which is increasingly present in such platforms.",
