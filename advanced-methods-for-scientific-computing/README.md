# (2024/2025) Advanced Methods for Scientific Computing

These notes are an unofficial resource and shouldn't replace the course material or any other book on _advanced methods for scientific computing_. It is not made for commercial purposes. I've made the following notes to help me improve my knowledge and maybe it can be helpful for everyone.

As I have highlighted, a student should choose the teacher's material or a book on the topic. These notes can only be a helpful material.

The notes are taken from the books required for the course: 

- Course slides.

You can view/download the PDF [here](notes/advanced-methods-for-scientific-computing.pdf). In the [notes folder](notes/), you can also see the source code.

In the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) file you can see the changes made to each version of the PDF file. The versioning can be helpful if you want to understand if there are any new features/fixes in the file.

For any issue, [use the appropriate section](https://github.com/PoliMI-HPC-E-notes-projects-AndreVale69/HPC-E-PoliMI-university-notes/issues).

## Course Syllabus

According to the [official course syllabus](https://www11.ceda.polimi.it/schedaincarico/schedaincarico/controller/scheda_pubblica/SchedaPublic.do?&evn_default=evento&c_classe=836969&__pj0=0&__pj1=e067fdf9cd2a6f7c981884e97ebba6e5):

- **An overview of computing tools**:
    1. An overview of the C++ language, focusing on its functional components;
    2. Message passing paradigm: parallel programming using MPI, with examples;
    3. Shared memory paradigm: parallel programming with openMP, with examples;
    4. Main libraries for scientific computing.
- **The development of numerical software**: some examples of topical numerical methods will be selected, explained, and solved by the students under the guidance of the instructors. Possible examples include:
    1. Solving non-linear systems of equations;
    2. Dynamical systems;
    3. Multidimensional numerical quadrature;
    4. Methods for numerical optimization.
