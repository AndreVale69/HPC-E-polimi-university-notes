# (2023/2024) Software Engineering for HPC

These notes are an unofficial resource and shouldn't replace the course material or any other book on _software engineering_. It is not made for commercial purposes. I've made the following notes to help me improve my knowledge and maybe it can be helpful for everyone.

As I have highlighted, a student should choose the teacher's material or a book on the topic. These notes can only be a helpful material.

The notes are taken from the books/resources required for the course: 

- Course slides.
- SE4HPC Exercise Book.

You can view/download the PDF [here](notes/software-engineering-for-hpc.pdf). In the [notes folder](notes/), you can also see the source code.

For any issue, [use the appropriate section](https://github.com/PoliMI-HPC-E-notes-projects-AndreVale69/HPC-E-PoliMI-university-notes/issues).
