\subsection{From Mathematical to Numerical Problem}

\subsubsection{The mathematical problem}

Let us consider a \definition{Physical Problem (PP)} endowed with a \textbf{physical solution}, let say $u_{ph}$, and \textbf{dependent on data} indicated with $g$.

\highspace
The \definition{Mathematical Problem (MP)} is represented by the \textbf{mathematical formulation of the PP} and has \textbf{mathematical solution} $u$. Therefore, we indicate the MP as:
\begin{equation}\label{eq: mathematical problem}
    \mathcal{P}\left(u; g\right) = 0
\end{equation}
Where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $u \in \mathcal{U}$
    \item $g \in \mathcal{G}$, and $\mathcal{G}$ is the set or space of \textbf{admissible data}.
\end{itemize}
Where $\mathcal{U}$ and $\mathcal{G}$ are suitable sets or spaces.

\begin{definitionbox}[: Model Error]
    The error between the physical and mathematical solutions is called \definition{Model Error}:
    \begin{equation}
        e_{m} := u_{ph} - u
    \end{equation}
    Where:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $u_{ph}$ is the physical solution;
        \item $u$ is the mathematical solution.
    \end{itemize}
\end{definitionbox}

\noindent
The model error takes into account all those \textbf{characteristics of the PP that are not represented or captured by the MP}.

    \textcolor{Green3}{\faIcon{question-circle} \textbf{When a Mathematical Problem is \emph{well-posed}?}}
\end{flushleft}
\begin{definitionbox}[: well-posed MP]
    The mathematical problem MP is \emph{well-posed} (\textbf{stable}) if and only if there \textbf{exists a unique solution} $u \in \mathcal{U}$ \textbf{that continuously depend on the data} $g \in \mathcal{G}$.
\end{definitionbox}

\noindent
From the previous definition, we remark that $\mathcal{G}$ is the set of admissible data, i.e., those for which the MP admits a unique solution. Furthermore, \emph{continuously depend on the data} means that \textbf{small perturbations on data} $g \in \mathcal{G}$ \textbf{lead to small changes on the solution} $u \in \mathcal{U}$ of the MP. However, a measure of this sensitivity is given by the condition number of the MP.
