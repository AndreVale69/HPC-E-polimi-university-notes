\subsubsection{PDE, initial and boundary value problem in 1D}

\definition{Initial and boundary value problem in 1D} is a type of problems that concern equations that \textbf{depend on space and time}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The \textbf{unknown solution} $u = u\left(x,t\right)$ both depends on the space coordinate $x \in \Omega \subset \mathbb{R}$ in 1D;
    
    \item The \textbf{time variable} $t \in I \subset I$.
\end{itemize}
In this case, the initial conditions at $t = 0$ must be prescribed, as well as the boundary conditions at the ends of the interval in 1D.

The \definition{Heat equation}, also known as \definition{Diffusion equation}, with Dirichlet boundary conditions assumes the following form: find $u: \Omega \times I \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ such that:
\begin{equation}
    \begin{cases}
        \dfrac{\partial u}{\partial t}\left(x,t\right) - \mu \dfrac{\partial^{2}u}{\partial x^{2}}\left(x,t\right) = f\left(x,t\right) & x \in \Omega = \left(a,b\right), t \in I \vspace{1em} \\
        %
        u\left(a,t\right) = u\left(b,t\right) = 0 & t \in I \\
        %
        u\left(x, t_{0}\right) = u_{0}\left(x\right) & x \in \Omega = \left(a,b\right)
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}

    For example, the unknown function $u \left(x,t\right)$ describes the temperature in a point $x \in \Omega = \left(a,b\right)$ and time $t \in I$ of a metallic bar covering the space interval $\Omega$. The diffusion coefficient $\mu$ represents the thermal response of the material and it is related to its thermal conductivity. The Dirichlet boundary conditions express the fact that the ends of the bar are kept at a reference temperature (zero degrees in this case), while at time $t = t_{0}$ the temperature is assigned in each point $x \in \Omega$ through the initial function $u_{0}\left(x\right)$. Finally, the bar is subject to a heat source of linear density $f\left(x,t\right)$.
