\section*{Preface}

Every theory section in these notes has been taken from the sources:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Course slides.\cite{numerical-linear-algebra-polimi}
\end{itemize}

These notes are an unofficial resource and shouldn't replace the course material or any other book on numerical linear algebra. It is not made for commercial purposes. I've made the following notes to help me improve my knowledge and maybe it can be helpful for everyone.

As I have highlighted, a student should choose the teacher's material or a book on the topic. These notes can only be a helpful material.

\subsection*{Correlated Projects}

During the Numerical Linear Algebra for HPC course, I was part of a team where we created a project that included two challenges related to the course. See more details in the corresponding repository:
