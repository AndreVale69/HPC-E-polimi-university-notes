Every theory section in these notes has been taken from the sources:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Quantum Mechanics.\cite{berera2021quantum}
    \item Fondamenti di fisica atomica e quantistica.\cite{ciccacci2020fondamenti}
    \item Modern Quantum Mechanics.\cite{sakurai2020modern}
\end{itemize}

These notes are an unofficial resource and shouldn't replace the course material or any other book on quantum physics. It is not made for commercial purposes. I've made the following notes to help me improve my knowledge and maybe it can be helpful for everyone.

As I have highlighted, a student should choose the teacher's material or a book on the topic. These notes can only be a helpful material.
